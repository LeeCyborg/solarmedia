These are the hardware requirements for the Solar Reader mashup using OTS parts
This can be easily adapted to do many more things and work with a variety of different boards
---

ESP8266 -- dev board, I'm using nodeMCU
3W solar panel -- you can use whatever, smaller is better since you only need to measure relatively
LCD 16x2 -- I used non I2C, and saved on a converter, but spent it on wires
1 potentiometer -- for non I2C LCD
Two resistors -- I used 10K, they need to be the same to create a voltage divider
Barrel connector (male and female)  -- easiest way to wire a solar panel for output
2 port screw terminal -- connecting solar panel to breadboard 

Oh and one breadboard!
